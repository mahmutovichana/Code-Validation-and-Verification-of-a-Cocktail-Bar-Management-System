# The Smart Café

## Overview

The Smart Café project is focused on the validation and verification of software, particularly in terms of code coverage and unit testing. Initially, the project was developed as a comprehensive application for a cafe, with order management functionalities. For this purpose, we drew upon the codebase from the Object-Oriented Analysis and Design course, where we previously created the Smart Café application with complete order management capabilities. However, in this iteration, we are concentrating solely on statistical analysis and menu management. The application will allow users to view café statistics, adjust drink prices, and apply filters based on ingredients. The menu can also be sorted by price.

We would like to express our gratitude to our client, Lagoon Cocktail Bar, for their collaboration and support during the testing and refinement phase of the application. Their valuable insights significantly contributed to the development of the Smart Café project.

The Smart Café team also extends its appreciation to the University of Sarajevo and the Faculty of Electrical Engineering for providing the necessary resources and guidance, enabling us to create this user-friendly web application.

Lastly, we acknowledge the indispensable role of open-source software and libraries in the development process, without which the creation of Smart Café would not have been possible.

## Conclusion

The Smart Café application simplifies the process of managing a café, allowing for efficient statistical analysis and menu management. Our team is committed to delivering an intuitive and seamless experience for café owners and administrators.
